# Product design

As I approach the task of learning Latin by reading, I ask myself: if I had infinite amount of time, what's the best front-end I could design to make this learning experience as smooth as possible being done on a desktop computer screen?

To assemble it, let's list the moving parts. DCC has already done a great job of shaping materials. How are we supposed to read Chapter 1:
- https://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/chapter-1 - chapters
- https://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/vocabulary-texts-and-maps - core vocabulary assembled by chapter

What tools do we have to enhance the navigation?
- Colors
- Tooltips
- Tables, diagrams
- Hover-overs, animation, visual links
