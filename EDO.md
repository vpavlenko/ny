# Equal Division of the Octave

TTSS argues that 12-edo works because most of its intervals are consonant.

I wonder whether that's necessary. Suppose it's not. Then what makes Western music comprehensible?

Music should be easily memorable. Moder Western music (jazz or classical influences aside) uses these means:
- diatonic scale (exact tonic isn't always recognizable due to lack of significance of cadential formulas)
- all chords in triads - built on the scale
- only major or minor chords used, a diminished triad isn't used
- four-chord progression as a first default
- a small inventory of very frequent progressions

First question: can we have the same progressions framework reused in other EDOs?

EDOs should be in unique position of having just a few chord types.

# Structures we're searching for

In any N-EDO, define a diatonic scale as any scale that doesn't have two consecutive semitones. I'm not sure we're actually need to restrict ourselves with exactly those scales: I'm not sure which of their properties are cool. Eg. consider minor #4b6 in 12-EDO - I quite like it.

Now, define an _orienting_ scale if it's not of limited transposition.

Too much talking. Let's build something.

A minimally viable object for us is a shuttle: a scale that will allow us having two triads.

I wonder whether we should base all triads on root-fifth relation, that is, whether root-upper interval should be the same for all types of chords we're using.

4-EDO has two different chords: 1-2-3 and 2-3-4. However, 4-EDO is fully intervallically enclosed in 12-EDO, therefore it's not an interesting musical object. It's a plain fully diminished seventh chord. Also, it's not a diatonic scale within a chromatic scale, and it's not orienting.
