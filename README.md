On Dec 20, 2024 I start my two-week New Year holidays celebration, in which I won't be doing any music theory. Instead, I'm gonna focus on fun things which I've postponed for forever.

# Human shader

I have a math degree, but I skipped classes on 3D. Still, I think I know all relevant concepts to understand the logic behind Human Shader's sheet.

# Video games

I wanna try "Papers, Please", "The Stanley Parable" and "Her Story".

# Ancient texts

I never studied any Latin or Greek. I wonder how long will it take before I can follow an actual ancient source and meaningfully trust the glossed translation.

# Lean

I have no idea about the current state of Lean theorem proving whatsoever. Is Hairy ball theorem proven in Lean yet? Can I verify that? What does it all mean?
