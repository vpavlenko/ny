# Equal Division of the Octave

TTSS argues that 12-edo works because most of its intervals are consonant.

I wonder whether that's necessary. Suppose it's not. Then what makes Western music comprehensible?

EDOs should be in unique position of having just a few chord types.

Let's see what we have for
