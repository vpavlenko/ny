On Dec 20, 2024 I start my two-week New Year holidays celebration, in which I won't be doing any music theory (almost). Instead, I'm gonna focus on fun things which I've postponed for forever.

Last time I was trying to nerd out like that was 5 years ago [at the Recurse Center](https://x.com/vitalypavlenko/status/1213917296596533250).

# Human shader

I have a math degree, but I skipped classes on 3D. Still, I think I know all relevant concepts to understand the logic behind Human Shader's sheet.

Also [this video](https://youtu.be/BFld4EBO2RE?si=P-vjFfOqr9Owb7ai)

# Video games

I wanna try "Papers, Please", "The Stanley Parable" and "Her Story".

Maybe all games from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seumas_McNally_Grand_Prize

"Papers, Please": got an ending 4 of 20.

# Films 

I want to watch types of films I haven't touched before.



# Ancient texts

I never studied any Latin or Greek. I wonder how long will it take before I can follow an actual ancient source and meaningfully trust the glossed translation.

I want to start with [simpler texts](https://chatgpt.com/share/67649d31-6378-800f-b150-6fbabe3ad80c), so [Cornelius Nepos's _Life of Hannibal_](https://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/preface)

First, I'd spent an hour reading https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/101/ handouts.

# Lean

I have no idea about the current state of Lean theorem proving whatsoever. Is Hairy ball theorem proven in Lean yet? Can I verify that? What does it all mean?

# 10-EDO

Since 2010 I was thinking about composing in 10-EDO. Or, rather, I wanted to understand, what that means, exactly.

Surprisingly, reading TTSS didn't help much, because TTSS touches zero concepts on actually bread&butter of composition: on functional harmony and on form.

Given that I've learnt a lot about it in the last few years, can I theorize on exploiting symmetries in N-EDOs for N <= 10 and compose something?

# Strudel

# Old collections of newspapers

# sitelen pona

# Glossing

Given the current state of LLMs, can I gloss Al Atlal to understand it?

# Tattoos on jeans

There's a culture of making tattoos on a human skin. That is, putting artwork for permanent stay on one's appearance.

Surprisingly, there isn't such culture for clothing. Why?

Can some plotters or other tools be used to make reproducible nice-looking things on jeans? Partizan Press-like?

# DSL for composition

Can I express compositions of https://rawl.rocks/corpus/manfred_schmitz in some sort of DSL/IR/JSX?

# Keyboard-only RTS, designing RTS
