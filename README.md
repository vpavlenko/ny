On Dec 20, 2024 I start my two-week New Year holidays celebration, in which I won't be doing any music theory. Instead, I'm gonna focus on fun things which I've postponed for forever.

Last time I was trying to nerd out like that was 5 years ago [at the Recurse Center](https://x.com/vitalypavlenko/status/1213917296596533250).

# Human shader

I have a math degree, but I skipped classes on 3D. Still, I think I know all relevant concepts to understand the logic behind Human Shader's sheet.

# Video games

I wanna try "Papers, Please", "The Stanley Parable" and "Her Story".

# Ancient texts

I never studied any Latin or Greek. I wonder how long will it take before I can follow an actual ancient source and meaningfully trust the glossed translation.

# Lean

I have no idea about the current state of Lean theorem proving whatsoever. Is Hairy ball theorem proven in Lean yet? Can I verify that? What does it all mean?

# 10-EDO

Since 2010 I was thinking about composing in 10-EDO. Or, rather, I wanted to understand, what that means, exactly.

Surprisingly, reading TTSS didn't help much, because TTSS touches zero concepts on actually bread&butter of composition: on functional harmony and on form.

Given that I've learnt a lot about it in the last few years, can I theorize on exploiting symmetries in N-EDOs for N <= 10 and compose something?

# Strudel

# Old collections of newspapers

# sitelen pona

# Glossing

Given the current state of LLMs, can I gloss Al Atlal to understand it?

# Tattoos on jeans
